# üéµ EarSketch-Songs
Songs I've made programming in Python with Earsketch!

These two songs were made in 2021 for a highschool project and competition. I came in first place voted by the faculty!

- table jam s2: [SolarJam](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/?sharing=UPixan2njk6qIdx8eU5Sog)

‚≠êAs of 9.21.24 I've decided to pick it back up and make more fun electronic music to publish collectively: **tablejam**

WIP:
